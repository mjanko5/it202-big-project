AIRPORTS ATMOSPHERE - readme file
=================================

This open-ended app can be used by pilots, tourists, and all other airporteers!
Search for a city, MAJOR airport, or airport code. Ex: Denver

The result is a list of airports.
Clicking an item from the list produces a detail page with info such as weather, details, and a map!
Enjoy exploring!

Some technical info:
--------------------

Endpoints used: Airports Database and Open Weather Map API.
NOTE: Airport endpoint is from a Google Script at Matt's account. I hope there is no authentication problems reaching this endpoint.

As a hardware feature, I utilized the speaker of the device. Just hit "Hear Airport Alarm" and enjoy!!

There is also an Indexed DB, which can be seen under "Search History". Finally, there is a Service Worker and Manifest.

The card component has several icon buttons that are not yet implemented. Clicking them produces no result. The image is also a placeholder image.
New enhancements are underway. Stay tuned.
